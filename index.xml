&lt;p>The last time I posted on this blog was in July 2023. At that time, I had taken a three-month break and was ready to start a new job, full of ambition and looking forward to the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last year, around this time, I came up with the idea of an &amp;ldquo;open diary&amp;rdquo; concept. It allows people to keep an open diary as a review and share it like a blog post. I wrote my first post back then, and now it has been a year.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>before 2022-07-26, I was using &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a>, and it has been working fine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>on 2022-07-26, when thinking about improving the blogging, there were a few functionalities that&amp;rsquo;s missing:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the googleAnalytics was broken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the commenting system was broken as well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>deployment has been hard &amp;ndash; I have to do it manually, by pushing to &lt;code>gh-pages&lt;/code> branch
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>although GitHub uses Jekyll by default, it&amp;rsquo;s missing some plugins that I use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>so I have to build it manually&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>in order to figure out what went wrong&amp;hellip; I started to read Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s source code
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it took me 0.5h, to roughly understand the basic code structure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>progressing slowly, but there were some progress anyway&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m also thinking &amp;ndash; why not give other system a try?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> before, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s written in Golang&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started to clone Hugo&amp;rsquo;s source code, and started reading.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Golang for the past 3 years, the code feels easy to read&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also went through the tutorial, and starting a new site from scratch
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>interestingly, the tutorial was easy to follow &amp;ndash; I have my site running within first 10min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it&amp;rsquo;s also easy to config &amp;ndash; the guides has been mostly easy to read, I can get the info I need within minutes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I happily coded until like 1am last night, and published this site to replace my previous one in Jekyll
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>this has been a great experience
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the templating system is easy to learn, and easy to figure out how to use it correctly, by reading the source code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I got all my issues with Jekyll resolved very fast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve also got other functionalities like multi-language support &amp;ndash; I can finally split my Chinese post from English ones&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>so it also makes me think, that I probably wanna pickup my previous habit of blogging again. So I start to write this post&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Summary from my experience, I think there&amp;rsquo;re a few learning points:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transform Any Website into Desktop App via Electron</title><link>https://songyangyu.com/posts/transform-any-website-into-desktop-app-via-electron/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://songyangyu.com/posts/transform-any-website-into-desktop-app-via-electron/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="end-result">End Result&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>When creating a merge request, we need to include more context information:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A pain point of reviewing a merge request, is to understand the context. The context includes:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>what the merge request actually intends to do&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="no-context-is-bad-for-reviewer">No Context is bad for Reviewer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>These context should be communicated properly, so that the reviewer can actually have a clue to justify if the change is necessary &amp;amp; sufficient.

not the implementation detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the ruby code below for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">add&lt;/span>(a, b)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+&lt;/span> b
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>one can test like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>expect( add(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>) )&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>to eq(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>that&amp;rsquo;s testing the result; but if one write test:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>expect( add(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>,&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>) )&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>to eq(&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>that&amp;rsquo;s testing the detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with testing the detail is that&amp;hellip; say if the dependent method,
&lt;code>:+&lt;/code> got changed, then the result would actually be different, but the second
spec would still pass.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CSRF protection in Rails</title><link>https://songyangyu.com/posts/csrf-protection-in-rails/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://songyangyu.com/posts/csrf-protection-in-rails/</guid><description>&lt;p>CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery) is an attack that forces an end user to

&lt;p>Since then.. I was fascinated by the idea of &lt;code>abstraction&lt;/code>&amp;hellip; and I think it&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">Answer: The answer is: it depends on the browser. class is a reserved word, but it is accepted as a property name by Chrome, Firefox and Opera. It will fail in IE. On the other hand, everybody will accept most other reserved words (int, private, throws etc) as variable names too, while class is verboten.

into, the meaningless things, rather than the meaningful ones. For example,
playing the game &amp;lsquo;clash of clans&amp;rsquo; is actually meaningless, because
everything is built on virtual data, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much difference to
people&amp;rsquo;s life; but, however, it does make some difference to the player&amp;rsquo;s
life: player has emotional attachment after invested a great amount of time
into that game, and lots of time (which can be potentially invested into
lots of other things) has been wasted. Put that in the context, the
opportunity for playing the game is really high.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speed is the king</title><link>https://songyangyu.com/posts/speed-is-the-king/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://songyangyu.com/posts/speed-is-the-king/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been always believing that.. Idea is cheap, because implementation is hard.
While for simple ideas, implementation is not-always hard, esp. when developer
only want to create a basic working example &amp;ndash; i.e., not worrying too much about
the detailed implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s believed that.. for a simple idea, 80% of the features &amp;ndash; the main feature,
can be implemented within 20% of the time &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s the main functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Concentraion and Focus</title><link>https://songyangyu.com/posts/on-concentraion-and-focus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://songyangyu.com/posts/on-concentraion-and-focus/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mr. Luo Yonghao&amp;rsquo;s Smartsian OS was published with Pre-alpha, and the outcome of
