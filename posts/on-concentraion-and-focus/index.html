that OS is pretty bad.</p><p>I read about the comments online, from <a href=www.zhihu.com>Zhihu</a> especially.
There&rsquo;was <a href=http://www.zhihu.com/question/21203867>one post</a> especially gained
my attendtion. It says that Mr.Luo is not a kind of consistent person &ndash; he
always try doing different things: English Teacher, English Education Agency,
NiuBo website, Movie Director, etc. Everything time when he wanted to do
something, he started really big &ndash; boast about how successful he can be, but
the end result is usually not that successful.</p><p>I&rsquo;m kind of.. like him in a certain sense, while this kind of like might be out
of the reason that I&rsquo;m sharing similiar kind of characteric with him. I like to
talk a lot, and I usually have lots of new ideas and got motivation to implement
them. Then after a while these ideas are just left undone.</p><p>Thus when looking back my resume, I got <em>none really good project to talk about</em>.</p><p>I should be very careful when I&rsquo;m starting a new project, or taking more
responsibility. It&rsquo;s OK if I do not take any responsibility, while if I start
taking some, I should seriously get it done.
The lame fact is, when I take the responsibilty, it&rsquo;s not only about me myself,
it&rsquo;s also about the position is filled therefore blocking other&rsquo;s chance of
getting this position. This further indicates that, to the employer, hiring
someone come with the opportunity, means he is putting his bet on this employee.</p><p>In this case here, the employee is me. If I cannot get things done perfectly,
it&rsquo;ll a lot better that I do not take the position in the first place.</p><p>I would keep this in mind: <em>less is more</em>. Get things work first, before making
it great.</p><blockquote><p>Early Optimization is the root of all evil
