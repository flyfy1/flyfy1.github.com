field &ndash; usually, consumer&rsquo;s need in a certain field, can be fulfilled by a
single company; company can only win the competition via diversity.</p><p>While for traditional business, due to the issue of scalibility, the market allows
multiple companies, with samilar nature of business, build the same product, to
exist in the market, together.</p><p>I try to summarize several properties of the internet-product / service:</p><h1 id=no-geo-location-issue>No Geo-Location Issue</h1><p>Because the product is virtual, geo-location is usually not an issue. Therefore,
as long as the product is built, the target user base can be anyone with access
to the internet.</p><h1 id=less-scalibility-issue>Less Scalibility Issue</h1><p>The marginal cost for the internet product, is very low. The price of adding
extra servers with the increased amount of users, can be near to 0 when
averaged.</p><h1 id=more-cultural--language-issue>More Cultural & Language Issue</h1><p>But <code>understanding</code> is a strong term here. Although not so obverious, different
area with different culture, would share different set of behaviours. Therefore,
there is actually a limition upon location, and that&rsquo;s the place that copy-cats
can take advantage of.</p><h1 id=more-experience-issue>More Experience Issue</h1><p>When the basic needs of consumer can be fulfilled, they&rsquo;re looking for something
with better experience. Comparing product A with product B, if consumer starts
to use A already, but B provides slightly better experience.. probably consumers
won&rsquo;t move to B because the reason issn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p><p>But when talking about user experience, every single detail counts. As the
better design accumulates, consumer would do feel a difference, and that is the
time when the &lsquo;first-mover&rsquo;s advantage&rsquo; start to lose.</p><p>Because the price of using / giving-up a product is nearly 0, it&rsquo;s quite easy
for the consumers to shift to another product.</p><p>Therefore, there&rsquo;re always space for competition &ndash; through diversity, and
better experiences.</p><h1 id=more-community-issue>More Community Issue</h1><p>There needs to be reasons for the consumer to stick with a product. Community is
definitely one of the reasons.</p><p>It&rsquo;s like some kind of slime, and users are like the molecules within &ndash; when
gethered together, it&rsquo;s less likely to break them. People of a feather, flocks
together.</p><h1 id=make-it-success-or-go-home>Make it Success, or Go Home</h1><p>Because of the fact that the high competition in the internet.. doing a start-up
is more like: you either put all your resources into one single spot, so that
you can gain a higher chance to win; or you&rsquo;ll simply lose and go home.</p><p>It&rsquo;s inequality. It&rsquo;s a game, that winner takes all.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://songyangyu.com/>&copy; Yangyu's Notes 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
