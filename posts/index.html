what the merge request actually intends to do why such changes are needed are there any other alternatives No Context is bad for Reviewer These context should be communicated properly, so that the reviewer can actually have a clue to justify if the change is necessary & sufficient.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/testing-result-not-detail/ class="link black dim">Testing Result not Detail</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When writing specs, I think the spec should describe implementation result, but not the implementation detail.
Take the ruby code below for example:
def add(a, b) a + b end one can test like:
expect( add(1,2) ).to eq(3) that&rsquo;s testing the result; but if one write test:
expect( add(1,2) ).to eq(1+2) that&rsquo;s testing the detail.
The problem with testing the detail is that&mldr; say if the dependent method, :+ got changed, then the result would actually be different, but the second spec would still pass.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/csrf-protection-in-rails/ class="link black dim">CSRF protection in Rails</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated.
