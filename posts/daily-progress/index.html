<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1"><meta name=description content="In the recent 2 days, I&rsquo;ve spent some good time setting up this blog site&mldr; here&rsquo;s the rough timeline:

before 2022-07-26, I was using Jekyll, and it has been working fine
on 2022-07-26, when thinking about improving the blogging, there were a few functionalities that&rsquo;s missing:

the googleAnalytics was broken
the commenting system was broken as well
deployment has been hard &ndash; I have to do it manually, by pushing to gh-pages branch

although GitHub uses Jekyll by default, it&rsquo;s missing some plugins that I use
so I have to build it manually




in order to figure out what went wrong&mldr; I started to read Jekyll&rsquo;s source code

it took me 0.5h, to roughly understand the basic code structure
progressing slowly, but there were some progress anyway


meanwhile, I&rsquo;m also thinking &ndash; why not give other system a try?

I&rsquo;ve heard about Hugo before, and I know it&rsquo;s written in Golang
I started to clone Hugo&rsquo;s source code, and started reading.

because I&rsquo;ve been working with Golang for the past 3 years, the code feels easy to read


I also went through the tutorial, and starting a new site from scratch

interestingly, the tutorial was easy to follow &ndash; I have my site running within first 10min
it&rsquo;s also easy to config &ndash; the guides has been mostly easy to read, I can get the info I need within minutes




I happily coded until like 1am last night, and published this site to replace my previous one in Jekyll

this has been a great experience

the templating system is easy to learn, and easy to figure out how to use it correctly, by reading the source code
I got all my issues with Jekyll resolved very fast
I&rsquo;ve also got other functionalities like multi-language support &ndash; I can finally split my Chinese post from English ones


so it also makes me think, that I probably wanna pickup my previous habit of blogging again. So I start to write this post



Summary from my experience, I think there&rsquo;re a few learning points:"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.140.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="Yangyu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://songyangyu.com/posts/daily-progress/><meta property="og:url" content="https://songyangyu.com/posts/daily-progress/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yangyu's Notes"><meta property="og:title" content="Daily Progress"><meta property="og:description" content="In the recent 2 days, I’ve spent some good time setting up this blog site… here’s the rough timeline:
