When working in big companies like Grab, lots of times I&rsquo;m just solving some simple CRUD.
Meanwhile, lots of my time needed to be spent upon different other things:

make and review pull request
deployment
fixing failures for functional test and unit test
load testing
integrated with the logging library

Problem
Turns out, there&rsquo;re also other teams, solving the same problem again and again.

by a team of engineering excellence people &ndash; define the patterns, the processes, the monitoring dashboards, and the
basic engineering tools.</p><p><code>Heroku</code> is one of such example: they handle the CI/CD, monitoring, auto-scaling, infra-upgrade for you, and you only
need to care about the pure business logic (while&mldr; still with some basic configuration to tell the tool on what you
