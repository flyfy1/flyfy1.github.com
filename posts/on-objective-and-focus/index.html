When reading, what am I reading about?
I have been reading a lot this year. Not only the Tech Specs (which I always
do), but also the blog posts (which I often do), as well as the books (which I
mostly started this year only). To make my statement stronger, here&rsquo;s a list of
books I&rsquo;ve read this Year.

books this year&rdquo; in my new year resolution)."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.140.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="Yangyu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.d05fb5f317fcf33b3a52936399bdf6f47dc776516e1692e412ec7d76f4a5faa2.css><link rel=canonical href=https://songyangyu.com/posts/on-objective-and-focus/><meta property="og:url" content="https://songyangyu.com/posts/on-objective-and-focus/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yangyu's Notes"><meta property="og:title" content="on Objective, and Focus"><meta property="og:description" content="One should always reflect upon himself… to keep on the right track, to find out and correct mistakes, and to the greater self-awareness.

do), but also the blog posts (which I often do), as well as the books (which I
mostly started this year only). To make my statement stronger, here&rsquo;s <a href=/books-2016/>a list of
books I&rsquo;ve read this Year</a>.
(I&rsquo;m recording them down because there&rsquo;s a line stating &ldquo;to read more than 50
books this year&rdquo; in my new year resolution).</p><p>It seems to be lots of books.. however, I&rsquo;ve forgot the content of most of them.</p><p>Such kind of feeling also come when I was reading about blog-posts online &ndash; the
title interests me, the content interests me, I&rsquo;ve read each of the word..</p><p>Immediately after I&rsquo;ve done reading the book, I feel good &ndash; yeah, I&rsquo;ve managed
to complete sth.. and it&rsquo;s so informative!</p><p>The next day, I&rsquo;ve forgot most of the information from the post.</p><h1 id=when-i-do-something-what-am-i-really-doing>When I do something, what am I really doing?</h1><p>So the question about reading is: when I&rsquo;m reading a book.. what am I actually
reading?</p><p>In order to answer the question with book is simple: gaining information.
Although some of the information are lost.. I <em>might</em> still have a shallow
memory about this book.. so that next time when I see similiar things.. at least
I know here to reference to / from.</p><p>However, this question can be generalized to.. things in general:</p><blockquote><p>When I do something, what am I really doing? What am I really going for?</p></blockquote><p>Human is a creator with ability to reason about sth. Therefore, we, as a human,
have <em>motivation</em> to do certain things, and we do expect a certain outcome.</p><p>The outcome can be like, &ldquo;I feel good in this short period of time&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is
for my long term goal&rdquo;. It must be something.</p><h1 id=start-with-why---why-i-do-certain-things--why-certain-things-happened>Start with why - why I do certain things / why certain things happened</h1><p>So.. are we really know what we&rsquo;re doing?</p><p>We do things because we want to persue our goal in the long term run.. but why
are we doing such things.. how can it help with the long term goal?</p><p>Do we even know what our long-term goal is?</p><p>I think most of the people might not know what he/she really want to do in
life.. if someone claim that he know.. most likely, his <code>know</code> is just for that
particular time&mldr; it would change as time passes.</p><p>However, there&rsquo;s a simple techique, which can help building what we want to do.
I call it <code>starts with why</code>. It&rsquo;s based on a simple assumption: things happen,
with a reason. So in order to make sure that we are making the right reasoning..
we need to ask: why such thing happen? Especially.. we need to ask about the
fundamental concepts &ndash; something it&rsquo;s so basic that it is like it has been
progrommed into our mind, so that when we&rsquo;re doing our reasonings.. we often
skip such steps. Some questions like:</p><ul><li>Why do I need to care about what others think about me?</li><li>Why do I need to social with other people?</li><li>Why do I have to earn money?</li><li>Why do I need to sleep?</li></ul><p>Asking why does not mean that we can stop doing something.. but asking why would
help us see things clearly.. so that when we&rsquo;re making our tradeoffs, we know
what we can afford to lose, and where&rsquo;s the base line.</p><h1 id=proactive--reactive>Proactive / Reactive</h1><p>In the famous book &lt;7 habits of highly effective people>.. it talks about
<code>proactive</code> and <code>reactive</code>. Basically, being proactive means to make your own
decision, to actively carry out your plans, and to act based on long-term goal;
while being <code>reactive</code> means to react based upon external factors &ndash; whether,
other people&rsquo;s reaction, etc.</p><p>Reactive people is actually wasting their brain &ndash; one of the key difference
between huamn, and machine, is that human have motivations by heart. It&rsquo;s easy
for a machine to be reactive &ndash; it only need to consider the current state, plus
some simple rules.</p><p>However, we&rsquo;re all reactive, in certain things.</p><p>See further, be proactive. Start with why.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//songyangyu.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://songyangyu.com/>&copy; Yangyu's Notes 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
