Otherwise, the reviewer would have to eye-balling each change, and try to guess why such changes are needed - this is time consuming. With these cognitive overheads, reviewer would tends to:</p><ul><li>slower the review process.. because we don&rsquo;t like to do hard things first</li><li>blindly say <code>yes</code>, because it&rsquo;s easier</li><li>focus on syntax, rather than (structural) design decisions - because it&rsquo;s also easier, and doesn&rsquo;t needs a complete understanding of the story</li></ul><p>with such things happens, it&rsquo;s kind-of defeat the purpose of peer-review: slower review would slow down the development, and syntax kind of comments should be made by automation.</p><h1 id=sample-template>Sample Template</h1><p>Ideally, a proper merge request should describe the context listed above.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>What&#39;s this about
