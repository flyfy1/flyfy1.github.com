## dotFiles

On Github: <https://github.com/flyfy1/dotFiles>

** Motivation **

There're lots of [dot files](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles) on the
internet. What's so special about this? It does the following extra things:

- auto download the list of vim plugins
- auto creating the symbolic link back to the home folder
- in the case that you've added a new dot files, you can easy move the files
  into this project folder, and create a corresponding symbolic link, with just
  one simple command.
