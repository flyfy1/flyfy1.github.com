Listing a list of books in the past. I was originally including it within one
of the blog posts.. but then I feel this information should be separated
instead.

Books that I highly recommend has been put in bold.

This is a listing of English Books. The Chinese book list can be fond
[here](/books-read/cn/).

For the books after Year 2017, I'll list them in H3 HTML tag, and adding in a
short description (or, if I have, I'll add in a link)
