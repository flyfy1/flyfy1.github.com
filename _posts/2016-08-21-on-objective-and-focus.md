# When reading, what am I reading about?

I have been reading a lot this year. Not only the Tech Specs (which I always
do), but also the blog posts (which I often do), as well as the books (which I
mostly started this year only). To make my statement stronger, here's a list of
books I've read this Year (I'm recording them down because there's a line
stating "to read more than 50 books this year" in my new year resolution):


It seems to be lots of books.. however, I've forgot the content of most of them.

Such kind of feeling also come when I was reading about blog-posts online -- the
title interests me, the content interests me, I've read each of the word.. 

Immediately after I've done reading the book, I feel good -- yeah, I've managed
to complete sth.. and it's so informative!

The next day, I've forgot most of the information from the post.

# When I do something, what am I really doing?


# Start with why - why I do certain things / why certain things happened


# Long term plan, and focused life


# Proactive / Reactive
