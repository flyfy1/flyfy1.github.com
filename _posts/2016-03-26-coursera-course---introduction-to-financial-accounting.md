Continued from the last post [on coursera courses](
http://localhost:4000/resources/2016/03/25/coursera-courses-should-consider-taking.html
), I've decided to start taking my first one out of the list -- 
[Introduction to Financial Accounting](
https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting/).

Since the course is charging 95USD, and I don't want to pay... because I don't
think extra value gain through the paying of the course, would worth the 95 USD.
Here's the detail:

- Benefit #1: certificate. I don't need a certificate to show off.. I need the 
  knowledge instead
- Benefit #2: grading. It seems that.. the course quiz grading only available 
  to the paid students now. This is something I need.. but I don't think it
  worth.. of spending 100 USD to buy 40 questions. (on the other hand.. if
  it is human graded.. I'll consider buying the course)

However, I do think that it is important to: 

- Verify the answer  
- Record the learning process


Therefore.. I come up with this idea: after each week, I'll just post my answer
to the quizs here.. in image format.

So here it begins.
