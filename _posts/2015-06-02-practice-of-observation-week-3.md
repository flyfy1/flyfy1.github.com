I was being.. really really lazy previously. While additionally, I'm having some
kind of profectionalism mindset -- if I do something, I'll try to do it
perfectly; otherwise, I'd rather not do it at all.

However, things like culturing a habit, which are very easy to give up, would be
harmful with that mindset -- once I stop, I'll really stop, cuz I know that the
longer I pause, the harder it is to continue.

While on the countary, thing like 'keeping a habit' is like streaming over 
UDP -- it is perfectly fine to lost some packages (dates), as long as it is
still continuous overalll.

Meanwhile, let me also declare this simple fact that -- I'm going to start each
week on Monday :)

## 1st June, 2015 - Monday

Let me talk about something reminds me today: if today is the last day of your
life, what do you wanna do?  (I got this question in mind, because I'm seriously
sick these days -- having a favor of 39 degree..)

I think for me, the most important thing is to pass down my own identity: my
gene, my ideas, my inventions, etc. This corresponds to the four basic
motivations people got (from the famous book -- <The Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People>): to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy.

I feel that.. life to a individual is meaningless -- the life of a single a
person, is just a tiny little dot in the long history of the universe. All lifes
are equal, in a sense that everyone will die someday.

Life is only meaningful, when it has influence to other people: what you have
brought to other people: happiness, tears, etc.

To me, I feel that the most meaningful thing to do is education. self-learning
ability is one of the most important abilitys in the world.. it's like
'meta-ability' -- the ability which one can use, to gain other abilities.
However, this isn't really taught much in school, or even in the universities.
Therefore, if I got sufficient amount of money & influence power, I'll like to
share / teach / discuss about the following meta-abilities:

- Self-leanring: learning how to learn
- Introspection: examine about the points to be improved.
- Calcurtaling Curiousity: build the curious mind, therefore giving people
  motivation to learn new things.
- Analytic Skills: the ability to abalize, based upon observations. This is the
  main motivation I have, in this "observation game"

That's it for today :)
