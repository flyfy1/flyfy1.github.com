The ability of observation & analysis is pretty important: it basically helps
one's quality of life, and finding / creating new opportunities (which would
further, transform into something that one desires -- fortune, time, items).

Observation & analysis is linked together. With strong observation ability, one
should be able to realise small innormal things, which further helps the
analysis -- because one can then gain more data to make a concrete conclusion.

However, sad thing is that.. most people do not have a strong observation & 
analysis ability -- that's why most opportunities are flouting in the outside
world, while still people claiming that there're so little opportunites which
can be used to make a fortune.

Luckily, this ability can be practiced. I think one good way of practicing it,
is to start with: induction through observation. In chinese, it's `格物致知`.
Here is how to do it:

1. Take a picture of something from your daily life
2. Observe it, and gain information which is not so direct from the item itself.
  1. What induction you can make, out of the observation
  2. How does it works, from how it looks
  3. If possible, how to improve the design / machsim


Let me start with one example. Here's a picture of a bottle of Alcohol, which I
drink yesterday.

The analysis starts now:

1. It has quite some water drop on the bottle, which indicates that it's right
   taken out of the fridge; and it is still cold.
2. The liquid looks a bit blury, having some small small bubbles inside, which
   indicates that it is carbon-dioxided. 
3. In the bottom right corner, it writes "natural mint flavour, life juice, cane
   sugur", which indicates that the alocohol has certain flavour; usually this
   kind of alocohol have a pretty low percentage of `CH3CH2OH` -- it is meant
   more for drink, rather than drunk. 


Hmm let's start small. If anyone who is interested with this exercise, we can do
this together. There're two things you can do:

1. I'll take a photo one day before the analysis, and publish it. If you're
   interested, you may mail it to: `geekysong at gmail dot com` with your
   analysis. I promise I'll only check my mail box after I finsh my version of
   analysis.
2. You can take a photo, and send me the analysis. I may consider using your
   version of photo in future.

What's good for you to pick the 1/2 options from the list above? Well.. opinions
from one person might be biased. With some peer-review, one can hopefully find
the blank point, mutually.


Here the game starts :)


Homework for tomorrow:
