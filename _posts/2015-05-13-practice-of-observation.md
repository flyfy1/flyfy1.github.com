The ability of observation & analysis is pretty important: it basically helps
one's quality of life, and finding / creating new opportunities (which would
further, transform into something that one desires -- fortune, time, items).

Observation & analysis is linked together. With strong observation ability, one
should be able to realise small innormal things, which further helps the
analysis -- because one can then gain more data to make a concrete conclusion.

However, sad thing is that.. most people do not have a strong observation & 
analysis ability -- that's why most opportunities are flouting in the outside
world, while still people claiming that there're so little opportunites which
can be used to make a fortune.

Luckily, this ability can be practiced. I think one good way of practicing it,
is to start with: induction through observation. In chinese, it's `格物致知`.
Here is how to do it:

1. Take a picture of something from your daily life
2. Observe it, and gain information which is not so direct from the item itself.
  1. What induction you can make, out of the observation
  2. How does it works, from how it looks
  3. If possible, how to improve the design / machsim

Let me start with one example. Here's a picture of a bottle of Alcohol, which I
drink yesterday.

![Image of An Alcohol](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9778027/images/poo-alocohol.jpg)

The analysis starts now:

1. It has quite some water drop on the bottle, which indicates that it's right
   taken out of the fridge; and it is still cold.
2. The liquid looks a bit blury, having some small small bubbles inside, which
   indicates that it is carbon-dioxided. 
3. In the bottom right corner, it writes "natural mint flavour, life juice, cane
   sugur", which indicates that the alocohol has certain flavour; usually this
   kind of alocohol have a pretty low percentage of `CH3CH2OH` -- it is meant
   more for drink, rather than drunk. 


Hmm let's start small. If anyone who is interested with this exercise, we can do
this together. There're two things you can do:

1. I'll take a photo one day before the analysis, and publish it. If you're
   interested, you may mail it to: `geekysong at gmail dot com` with your
   analysis. I promise I'll only check my mail box after I finsh my version of
   analysis.
2. You can take a photo, and send me the analysis. I may consider using your
   version of photo in future.

What's good for you to pick the 1/2 options from the list above? Well.. opinions
from one person might be biased. With some peer-review, one can hopefully find
the blank point, mutually.


Here the game starts :)

Image of today: 
![Image of A lift](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9778027/images/poo-lift.jpg)

The analysis starts now:

1. Seems there're two levels: Street & Ticket Concourse. Therefore, high chance
   it is taken within an MRT of Singapore.
2. The text on the buttons is quite blurred -- indicates two possibilities: a)
   there're lots of people using the lift daily; b) the lift is pretty old.
   Considering the fact that the image on the yellow button is quite clear, I
   belive there're more people, than the lift being old.  
3. The button for "Street" is highlighted. That means the lift is going up to
   the street level; while the door haven't been opened yet.
4. Looking at the two buttons at the bottom -- the one on the right (close door)
   is way more blurred then the one on the left (open door). This indicates that
   there're way more times people press the 'close door' button, than clicking
   upon the 'open door' button. Which further indicates that, people using this
   lift are more 'rush' -- they tends to go ASAP, rather than waiting for
   someone else. (while actually, the truth is that... for that lift, you have
   to press the 'close door' button so that the door would be actually closed)

BTW, interestingly, I've got a reply. For the confidentiality, let me don't post
it yet.

I think this is really an interesting game. Let's welcome more people to join.
More interestingly, you may send to me annoymously. I'm also planning to host a
website for this activitiy in the near future :)

Keep doing, don't settle :)

this is a photo taken downstair of the block I'm staying.
![Image of A downstairs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9778027/images/poo-downstairs.jpg)

The analysis starts now:

1. The photo seems to be taken at night. Cuz the light on the left side hve a
   little bit of cyan colar -- which is the color of a light source; also if one
   zoom the image, there're quite some noise -- which means lacking of light
   source.
2. the wall is turning a little bit dirty, as well as the ground. Indicating the
   block is a little bit old, at least not recently renovated.
3. If one zoom the image, then one can see that on top of the doors, it has a
   sign `Electrical & Tel  xxxxx`, and `Gas & Water` -- which indicates that it
   is a control room.
4. There's a red `R2` sign on the big pipe on the right. I don't know what it
   means; but I think it might be wa
