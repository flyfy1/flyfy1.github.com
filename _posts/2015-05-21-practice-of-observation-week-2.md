`External Contributed`, quote from the original poster:

This is a notice board for a vehicle access control system of a small one-way
road. The width of the road is around 2.5m. The road is in campus. On the one
side of the road is a lake, the other side is near to halls for students.

The analysis starts

1. This is a barrier in a parking lot. Concluded from 15min of grace period,
   free exit, and barrier arm at the bottom
2. It has a screen, the sign board above the button sys 'AIPHONE'. Should be
   designed for communication purpose.
3. It have a slot of "insert cash card". But think about the use case, it is
   pretty ridiculous -- we cannot expect the dirver to physically open the door
   of the car, come down and insert the card. There should be a sensor
   somewhere; otherwise, the driver must try very hard to lean out the hand &
   insert the card -- in that case, the card slot should be around 0.8m high, so
   that it is easier for the driver to reach while sitting
4. According to my memory, the bar is often raised, and there's little traffic
   on the road. Therefore, this parking lot is rarely used.

I feel thinking about how to improve a certain item is even more interesting
than simply make observation.

Today's topic: what can one do in MRT~?

The analysis starts:

1. The one I always enjoy doing -- reading a book. In fact, I've finished 'Pro
   Git' purely on MRT, and later "Ruby MetaProgrammin", when I was intern in
   Paypal.
2. Observation. By observing people around you, one can learn a lot about
   people's behaviour in MRT: what they do, how they look like, what does it
   indicates.
3. Making Friends. Try talking to the one sitting next to you, you may
   potentially find some new friends. Everyone has some pretty nice story
   behind, waiting to be discovered & shared.
4. Coding. If one is taking MRT for like...2h, then it's quite worth it to do
   some coding on the train. Actually, it's pretty effective (aside from the
   part that you don't have internet connection)
5. Sight Seeing. I think one good way to know a city is.. through actually
   experience it. MRT is a good way to experience a city, cuz it links lots of
   different places. Just by looking outside, one can gain a rough knowledge
   about how a perticular area is like.

This is a image from a (pretty) annoymous user. The image is pretty
self-expressive. I got this image at around 18:25.

The analysis starts:

1. Considering the time & it's on MRT, this is taken on the way back home.
2. It's reaching downtown line. Cuz the lady is looking outside.
3. It's Bugis -> Chinatown direction. Cuz although it looks a bit empty,
   there're people standing on the train, and there're not many people doing
   ChinaTown -> Bugis at this point (needs to check this point)
4. The girl on the right in the picture seems to be in the middle of using the
   cellphone, and then something happened, and looking at that.
5. The girl in the middle was looking outside the window. I feel it's probably
   because that the train just went out.

## Homework tomorrow

Let's talk about.. how to make money, as a software engineer; and what to do, in
order to be richer :)
