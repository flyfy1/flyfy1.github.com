## Homework for tomorrow

`External Contributed`, quote from the original poster:

This is a notice board for a vehicle access control system of a small one-way
road. The width of the road is around 2.5m. The road is in campus. On the one
side of the road is a lake, the other side is near to halls for students.

## Homework for day after tomorrow

I feel thinking about how to improve a certain item is even more interesting
than simply make observation.

Today's topic: what can use do in MRT~?
