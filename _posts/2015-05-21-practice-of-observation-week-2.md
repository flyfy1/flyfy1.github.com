## Homework for tomorrow

`External Contributed`, quote from the original poster:

This is a notice board for a vehicle access control system of a small one-way
road. The width of the road is around 2.5m. The road is in campus. On the one
side of the road is a lake, the other side is near to halls for students.

The analysis starts

1. This is a barrier in a parking lot. Concluded from 15min of grace period,
   free exit, and barrier arm at the bottom
2. It has a screen, the sign board above the button sys 'AIPHONE'. Should be
   designed for communication purpose.
3. It have a slot of "insert cash card". But think about the use case, it is
   pretty ridiculous -- we cannot expect the dirver to physically open the door
   of the car, come down and insert the card. There should be a sensor
   somewhere; otherwise, the driver must try very hard to lean out the hand &
   insert the card -- in that case, the card slot should be around 0.8m high, so
   that it is easier for the driver to reach while sitting
4. According to my memory, the bar is often raised, and there's little traffic
   on the road. Therefore, this parking lot is rarely used.

## Homework for day after tomorrow

I feel thinking about how to improve a certain item is even more interesting
than simply make observation.

Today's topic: what can one do in MRT~?
